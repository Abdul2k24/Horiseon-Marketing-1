Hello there welcome to my first Readme! Below I will give a step by step follow through of how I was able work on this first challenge
The user story wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards 
# First
 I added Semantic HTML elements to make the code more structured instead of having alot of div tags
# Second 
make it follow a logical flow! such as header,nav, section, article and footer 

# Third
 I added alt attributes to all the images in the html code to make it more accessble 

# Fourth
 I updated the title to relfect the webpage instead of a generic website title 
I also noticed when working on the code that heading attributes were in the wrong order so I corrected that as well.

when looking at the CSS code I noticed that there were identical CSS values. That could all be exchanged for a single class. such as the benefit class. I then applied this to the HTML elements that previously used the various duplicate classes and make the code more clear.
