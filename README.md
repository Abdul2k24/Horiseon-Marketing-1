Hello there welcome to my first Readme! Below I will give a step by step follow through of how I was able work on this first challenge
The user story wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards 
# First
 I added Semantic HTML elements to make the code more structured instead of having alot of div tags
 in this case I added a header, nav, main, article, section and a footer
# Second 
I made it follow a logical flow! such as header,nav, section, article and footer 

# Third
 I added alt attributes to all the images and described them in the html code to make it more accessble

# Fourth
 I updated the title to relfect the webpage instead of a generic website title.
 In this case I named it "Horiseon Marketing Agency" as the title 

I also noticed when working on the code that heading attributes were in the wrong order so I corrected that as well.

when looking at the CSS code I noticed that there were identical CSS values. That could all be exchanged for a single class. such as the benefit class. 

I then applied this to the HTML elements that previously used the various duplicate classes and make the code more clear. after words I submitted all my edits and changes in commits and pushed my changes in my local repo to the github main
